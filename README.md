## Number Guessing Game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program prompts the player to enter their guess and provides feedback based on whether the guess is too low or too high. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number or decides to quit.

## Features
- User can choose the game's difficulty.
- Randomly generates a number within a specified range for each game.
- Accepts user input to guess the number.
- Provides feedback to the player on whether their guess is too low or too high.
- Tracks the generated random numbers throughout the game.
- Allows the player to interrupt the game by entering "q" to quit.
- Displays the list of random numbers generated during the game at the end.

## Usage
The program prompts the player to enter a number guess within a specified range. If the guess is lower than the randomly generated number, the program provides feedback to try again with a higher number. If the guess is higher, the program advises the player to try again with a lower number. Once the player correctly guesses the number, a congratulatory message is displayed.

The player can interrupt the game at any time by entering "q". Upon interruption, the program displays the list of random numbers generated during the game.

To play the game, run the program and follow the on-screen instructions. The game can be replayed multiple times, and the list of random numbers will be displayed at the end of each game.

## Modifications

~~- Implementing a limit on the number of attempts.~~
- Allowing the player to set custom ranges for the random numbers.
- Adding a scoring system to track the player's performance.
- Enhancing the user interface with graphics or sound effects.
